# Veiligheidsrendement Documentation.

This is the repository containing all the user's  documentation related to the entire Veiligheidsrendement Suite (or `VrtoolSuite`). The `VrtoolSuite` is composed by the following repositories:

- [Veiligheidsrendement](https://github.com/Deltares/Veiligheidsrendement/) (or  `vrtool`).
    - Includes the database definition and a `ORM` wrapper.
- [Veiligheidsrendement Tools](https://github.com/Deltares/VrToolPreprocess) (or `vrtoolpreprocess`). A set of tools for pre- and post-processing data for the `vrtool`.
- Data Dashboard (to be defined).

# How to write documentation
We will be using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate our documentation written in [markdown language](https://markdown-it.github.io/)
